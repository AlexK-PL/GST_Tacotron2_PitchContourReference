# GST_Tacotron2_PitchContourReference
A NVIDIA's Pytorch Tacotron2 adaptation with unsupervised Global Style Tokens. Instead of using the whole mel-scale spectrogram representation in the GST input, we extracted and used only the pitch contour in a sparse representation. The model has been trained with the English read-speech LJSpeech Dataset.
